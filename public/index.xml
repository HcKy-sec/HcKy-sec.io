    <description><![CDATA[This past weekend I decided to play around in the SHELL CTF in between working on my capstone project. Didn&rsquo;t have a ton of time but wanted to knock out some forensics challenges. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, forensics in this CTF was more stegonography challenges than anything else. Still fun though.

    <description><![CDATA[Not much of a break from the Hack the Box CTF. HeroCTF was pretty fun. Didn&rsquo;t have much time to poke at the challenges due to the multiple DDOS attacks on their servers over the weekend but from what I&rsquo;ve seen the organizers did a good job.

    <description><![CDATA[This weekend was the HackPack CTF for 2021.
It turns out the time I set aside on Satuday didn&rsquo;t amount too much since the CTF was from 1100EST Friday to 1100EST Saturday.
The challenges I looked through were pretty fun and I was only able to complete a few in the time I had.

# S.H.E.L.L CTF

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="logo.png"></a></div>  

This past weekend I decided to play around in the SHELL CTF in between working on my capstone project.  Didn't have a ton of time but wanted to knock out some forensics challenges. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, forensics in this CTF was more stegonography challenges than anything else. Still fun though.

    <description><![CDATA[This past weekend I decided to play around in the SHELL CTF in between working on my capstone project. Didn&rsquo;t have a ton of time but wanted to knock out some forensics challenges. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, forensics in this CTF was more stegonography challenges than anything else. Still fun though.

    <description><![CDATA[Not much of a break from the Hack the Box CTF. HeroCTF was pretty fun. Didn&rsquo;t have much time to poke at the challenges due to the multiple DDOS attacks on their servers over the weekend but from what I&rsquo;ve seen the organizers did a good job.

    <description><![CDATA[This weekend was the HackPack CTF for 2021.
It turns out the time I set aside on Satuday didn&rsquo;t amount too much since the CTF was from 1100EST Friday to 1100EST Saturday.
The challenges I looked through were pretty fun and I was only able to complete a few in the time I had.

    <description><![CDATA[This weekend was the yearly RITSEC CTF so I decided to give it a shot.
A team was required to sign up but you could register a team with only one player, which is what I did. The CTF took place from Friday to Sunday. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t have any time on Sunday so a few of the challenges I though I could get done didn&rsquo;t end up being completed.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This weekend was my first time competing in TraceLab&rsquo;s OSINT Searchparty, which is a CTF style event.
I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to really expect going into it since I&rsquo;ve never done one before. The event was brought up in the WGU Cyber Security Club so we actually had two different teams competing. I was the captain of my team devzero and the other team was called The Fowl Owls.

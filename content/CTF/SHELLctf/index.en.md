This past weekend I decided to play around in the SHELL CTF in between working on my capstone project.  Didn't have a ton of time but wanted to knock out some forensics challenges. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, forensics in this CTF was more stegonography challenges than anything else. Still fun though.
